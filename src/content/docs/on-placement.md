## Responsibilities

On commencement of a placement there are certain responsibilities placed on the student, the employer and the overall supervision of the student during the placement.

### The Student

- Complete the Health and Safety Induction check and upload to the Recruit system
- Complete the Placement Learning Agreement document and upload to the Recruit system.
- Have your employer complete the Placement Indemnity form and upload to the Recruit system. Where the company has any queries or expresses any concern in signing the form, then they should be referred to Employability and Careers who will deal with these issues.
- Update the placement details and industrial supervisor details on the Recruit system.
- The student will comply with all company regulations and conditions of employment.
- The student will work diligently and always behave in a manner appropriate to the work. environment – considering the professional issues elements of placement preparation.
- The student will complete the required assessment tasks and engagement in organisation of placement visits.
- The student will keep in contact with their allocated placement academic supervisor and where necessary placement tutor throughout the placement year and keep him/her fully informed of any difficulties or problems that may arise from time to time.
- Maintain a journal (logbook) and produce a report at the end of placement.

### The Company

- An industrial supervisor will normally be appointed by the company to manage and monitor the student’s work and assess the student at the end of the placement.
- A suitable programme of work providing the student with the opportunity to complete ‘real’ tasks that will eventually benefit the company. This should be documented in the placement learning agreement.
- A suitable working environment will be provided, including adequate access to computers etc.
- The company may identify a peer (mentor) who will help the student settle in and ‘show them the ropes’ during the first few weeks (this may be the outgoing placement student).
- At the start of the placement, the student will be provided with suitable introductory material, background reading, training etc. as required.
- The student will be paid an appropriate salary. (There are wide variations!)

### Supervison

- The University will appoint an academic member of staff as the “Academic Supervisor” (Placement Visitor) for each student at the beginning of the academic year.
- The Academic Supervisor will visit the student at work twice during the placement year. The first visit will typically take place in Nov/Dec and the second visit in (March/April). These can be adjusted as agreed with the Placement Tutor depending on circumstances of the placement (e.g. the placement start date). Placement visits may be in person or virtual (e.g. MS Teams).
- The day-to-day work of the student is monitored by the company Industrial Supervisor who is also required to make themselves available to attend the placement visits and provide the visitor with feedback on the students’ progress.
- If any problems arise which threaten the successful progress of the placement these should be taken up immediately between the student and the Company Supervisor. If a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the aggrieved party (student or Supervisor) should contact the relevant Academic supervisor as soon as possible. In cases where the issue cannot be resolved then the Academic supervisor can escalate the issue to the Placement Tutor.

## Starting Placement

Once you have started your placement you need to confirm some important data regarding your placement on the Recruit system. Guidance on using Recruit to add data required can be found in the [Recruit Guidance - Starting Placement](/sceis-placement-handbook/student/recruit/#starting-placement) section of the handbook.

This data includes

- student details
- employment details 
- placement plan (learning agreement)
- safety checklist

> It is vitally important that you complete these sections as soon as you start your placement and Recruit will send reminder emails until all sections have been completed. 

### Student Details

This section allows you to update your contact details, including home address and term address (whilst on placement). Please note that whilst we will primarily contact you via your University email, you should provide a personal email address and mobile number to only be used in those scenarios where we need to contact you urgently or where you are not responding to requests sent via your university email.

### Employment Details

This section allows you to update details of your actual placement, including job role, company details (address, tel no, placement email address) and *most importantly the confirmed start/end dates of your placement*.  

### Placement Plan

This section is used to construct a placement learning agreement. Whilst some of this information may have been pre-populated based on the information provided in the placement application, you should discuss with your employer, the work that you will be carrying out during the year and then update this section accordingly. 

### Safety Checklist

This section is of particular importance as it is used to confirm that you have completed any mandatory H&S checks with the company. Not all checks may be required depending on your role. If you have any concerns regarding health and safety you should note these and either inform your placement visitor (when known) or alternatively the placement coordinator.

This section also includes a very important question regarding employer liability insurance. For the vast majority of placements (99%+), you should be covered by your employers standard employee liability insurance (you are after all an employee of the company for the year). You should check this with the company and then confirm that you are covered.

Only in exceptional circumstances would an employer not provide cover and once you are sure that cover is not provided, select the option 'no cover provided'. This will then trigger a process where Recruit will email you and your industrial supervisor, a copy of the University liability policy which you and your employer will need to complete and sign. You then email this document back to the placement administrator who will store the document in Recruit.


## Placement Visits

### Purpose of a Visit

During the placement year the student will be visited twice by the academic supervisor. During these visits, the academic will speak to both the student and the supervisor to assess progress and formally assess the practical element of the placement.

### Visit Preparation

The academic supervisor will email you via your university account asking for suitable dates to carry out a visit. You should liaise with your industrial supervisor and ensure that they are also available at any agreed date/time.

The academic supervisor will then schedule the visit via [Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk), and you will receive an automated confirmation email with an attached calendar event. The student should then complete a placement visit summary form (found in the document section on Recruit) and upload this to the visit area on Recruit.

### What Happens at a Visit?

A Placement Visit will typically take up to one hour.  In the visit, the academic supervisor or will typically speak to the student and industrial supervisor separately to provide an opportunity to speak freely about the progress of the placement.

When meeting with the student, the academic supervisor will want to:

Verify at the first visit that:

1. The Health and Safety Check List has been completed and deal with any issues noted.
2. That the student has submitted a signed learning agreement.
3. That the student has submitted a signed company indemnity form.
4. That the student is aware of the company policy on bullying and harassment (i.e. does the student know what to do if they think they are being bullied or harassed?).
5. If the student has flagged any disability with the company, that the company has dealt with it in an appropriate manner. Under SENDO legislation employers must make reasonable adjustments to facilitate students with a range of disabilities including physical, visual, hearing, learning, medical and mental. Note that students are not obliged to disclose any disability.

Verify at both visits:

1. Discuss the type of work undertaken to date, training received, systems/tools used.
2. Look for evidence of soft skill enhancement.
3. Verify that the student has been maintaining their placement journal and where relevant provide some constructive comments.
4. Look for evidence of achievement of the placement competencies which contribute to the overall placement assessment.

When meeting with the industrial supervisor, the academic supervisor will want to:

- Gain an appreciation of the industrial supervisor view on the students’ strengths and weaknesses and their performance to date.
- Determine if there is any potential for more demanding or varied work. This can be of particular significance where the student feels the work currently being offered varies widely from that advertised via the original job description.
- Gain an appreciation of the work programme for the rest of the year.
- At the second visit determine if there will be a requirement for placement students the following year.
- Develop other Company – University Links.

The academic supervisor, in collaboration with the industrial Supervisor will then formally assess the students’ progress.

### What is a Journal?

Students are required to maintain a journal during their placement using the Recruit Journal feature. This presents a factual record of work experience that you have gained and the learning that you have achieved.  It will be a valuable resource for you in the preparation of your Placement Report. It will be inspected by your Academic Visitor at each visit, and by the assessor of your Placement Report.  Your journal will be used as an evidence source to corroborate your achievement of the Placement Competencies and claims that you make in your Placement Report.

Failure to maintain a satisfactory journal may therefore impair your performance in these components of your assessment. As this is a record of your work and learning experience, it should include

- Notes and observations on the work you have done. This might include (but is not limited to) any of the following (technical issues, business issues, social, legal & ethical issues, industrial relations, management practices).
- Reflections on the skills, knowledge, understanding and experience you have acquired.

You are advised to ensure that details of a technical nature comply with the organisation's policy and practice on confidentiality; company material may only be included if explicit permission has been given.

In general, you should begin making entries in your journal at the beginning of your placement and make approximately one entry each week until your placement is over. Journal entries will vary in length depending on many factors.  For example: descriptions of new experiences should be fully detailed, whilst descriptions of routine tasks might be briefly noted. Reflections on your learning might not occur in every entry but when they do, they might require a more detailed note. You may write in an informal style, but it should be understandable by a broad audience, including your assessors. As a rough guide, you should expect to write 100-200 words each week - with shorter entries being balanced by longer ones.

### What are Competencies?

Over the course of the placement year the student must demonstrate achievement of ten work-based competencies to pass the practical element of the placement year.

 1. Independence: It is expected that as your placement progresses, you can demonstrate that you have gained enough knowledge of your role, to be able to work in an independent manner and not require constant supervision.
 2. Flexibility: Can you demonstrate to your employer that you are flexible regarding the duties you may be allocated. Remember you are working in a commercial setting and the needs of the company come first – so it’s quite normal that your work/role may change over the year.
 3. Timekeeping: You must attend for work at the specified time – bad time keeping is one area that reflects badly on your reliability. You must ensure you follow work protocols regarding asking for time off, holidays etc.
 4. Teamwork: Companies want employees who are team players. Can you demonstrate that you are there to work in a team environment and will do whatever is necessary (when asked) to ensure the team meets its targets/goals.
 5. Interpersonal Skills: Can you demonstrate that you have good interpersonal skills when dealing with co-workers or customers. Have you good verbal and written communication skills?
 6. Self-awareness: Are you aware of your own skill set and areas that require attention? Do you listen to your industrial and academic supervisors and take any feedback provided in a constructive manner – with an aim to improve any areas that may require attention.
 7. Organisation and planning: Do you keep good records of duties assigned and do you ensure you plan your day to ensure you carry out your duties in a timely manner. Do you follow up with tasks that may require communication back to your supervisor, co-workers and customers?
 8. Health and Safety Awareness: Have you completed workplace Health and Safety induction and completed the Health and Safety checklist on Recruit. Do you follow all Health and Safety protocols (especially when working in an industrial/factory environment)?
 9. Social and Professional Awareness: Are you aware of your responsibility to present a professional image internally within an organisation and externally with customers. Are you aware of the need to treat any access you may have to sensitive information with the utmost respect, following ethical guidelines discussed during placement preparation (Professional Development)
 10. Technical Expertise: Finally, are you able to demonstrate good technical ability in your role – and most importantly can you demonstrate a progression in performance during the placement year.

## Placement Assessment

Over the placement year the student is working towards achievement of a Diploma in Professional Practice DPP (or DPP(I) in the case of a placement outside the UK/Ireland), and this is assessed in two parts.

### Visit Assessments

The overall practical element of placement is simply marked as ```Pass/Fail``` and you must pass to be eligible for the placement Diploma in Professional Practice award. For a pass to be achieved the student must demonstrate achievement of all placement competencies.

Assessment of these competencies is made at the placement visits. Students should review the feedback following the first visit regarding outstanding competences and what they need to work on for the second visit. Students should ensure they use the journal to record any evidence of meeting those competencies, so that they can talk about what they have achieved at the second visit and in the final report.

The placement visits are managed via the [Recruit system](/recruit/student#placement-visits).

### Final Report Assessment

As the student approaches the end of the placement, they will be required to submit a Final Placement Report (typically late May/early June), that documents their placement year. This report provides the student with an opportunity to highlight their knowledge of the organisation and team in which they work, training undertaken and duties of the post, and most importantly to reflect on the year and what they have achieved. The placement journal is a crucial tool in completion of the report as it will allow the student to record important information and reflection over the year that will be useful in constructing the report. This report is formally assessed and is used to determine the overall placement grade of ```Fail, Pass, Commendation or Distinction```.

The placement report is submitted via the [Recruit system](/recruit/student#final-report).

## Placement Issues

Whilst on placement, student can encounter various issues that will require consultation in the first instance with the industrial supervisor, the academic supervisor and ultimately the placement tutor.

### Role Not as Advertised

Sometimes the actual role given to the student may vary from that advertised in the original job specification. Students need to also realise that a company requires its employees to be flexible (one of the competencies) and carry out duties as required by the company at that time. However, if the change in duties is such that the student longer has an opportunity to carry out any of the work originally advertised, then the student should discuss this with the industrial supervisor in the first instance and then with the academic supervisor, to request work more aligned with what was originally advertised.

### Poor Performance

Where a student does not perform as expected in a placement role, the company may decide to terminate the placement. This is an **exceptional** occurence and would normally only happen when all avenues to address the issues identified have been exhausted.

Where issues do arise these would normally be discussed at the next available placement visit or where more urgent the industrial supervisor would contact the academic supervisor or placement tutor. Normally issues are related to the competencies outlined above with lack of technical ability being the most difficult to address. In most other cases the course of action required by the student is obvious and relies on the student taking responsibility for the issue(s) highlighted and being willing to take the necessary steps to address the issues.

### Redundancy

In some rare cases an employer may make a placement student redundant or worse the company itself may cease trading. The placement student should contact their assigned academic supervisor and the placement tutor as soon as they receive notification that redundancy is a possibility or that a company may cease trading. In the case where you are being made redundant, your company/organisation may show some flexibility regarding your placement by means of 1) continuing your placement with reduced salary, or 2) continuing your placement on a part-time basis.

Should either of these options be available; you should discuss your circumstances with your academic supervisor. Although this is not an ideal situation, you will need to balance the availability of alternative placement employment with the experience that you can gain with your current company/organisation.

Depending on when the redundancy takes place the student may have completed enough time in the role to meet the minimum placement duration and it may be necessary to arrange a placement visit outside the usual visit dates with your academic supervisor.

Where none of these options are available, the student will be provided with assistance in securing a replacement post.

### Bullying / Harassment

The University requires each employer to have a Bullying/Harassment policy in place and the student should have been made aware of this policy during their induction with the employer. The student should follow the procedures in this policy in the first instance and additionally inform their academic supervisor of their circumstances. If required, the placement tutor can speak to the company supervisor to ensure that the situation is being addressed, and where it is not being addressed, the University reserves the right to remove the student from the placement if required.

### Terminate a Placement

A student unilaterally terminating a placement before completion of the contract, is an exceptional situation and one that is normally extremely rare.

When a student undertakes a placement they will have normally signed a contract stipulating amongst other things the period of employment. The contract may also have some conditions around termination of the placement and these need to be honoured.

Where a student is considering leaving a placement, they **must** in the first instance discuss the issues they are having with their industrial supervisor and/or the academic supervisor. Where required the academic supervisor will discuss the issues that may have led to the request to terminate the post with the industrial supervisor and placement tutor and aim to have them resolved.

It is a requirement that a student does not withdraw from a placement, without the permission of the relevant Placement Tutor, who will have discussed the matter and had it approved by the student’s Course Director and where required, the Head of School within which their course resides.

> NOTE: Terminating a placement means that a student will not have successfully completed their placement year. In this case they will not be awarded the Diploma in Professional Practice DPP/DPP(I) and can at the discretion of the course committee, be required to repeat the year.
