## Introduction

Placement Visitors should be mindful that placement visits are a crucial element of the Teaching and Learning process and as such, like lectures, tutorials etc., they are an important aspect of their academic workload. Placement visits provide an opportunity for the visiting academic to assess student learning and performance in the workplace and compare that with students on other placements.

## Visit Guidelines

### Discuss With Student

The following items should be discussed with the student.

- First Visit
  - Verify the Health & Safety Checklist has been completed on Recruit and if the student has noted any issues. If so, then these should be discussed at the visit .
  - Ensure the student is aware of the relevant company policy on Bullying & Harassment and that they know what to do if they think they are being bullied or harassed.
  - Ask the student if they have flagged any disability with the company, if so, has the company dealt with it in an appropriate manner? Students are not obliged to disclose any disability.
    - Under SENDO legislation employers must make reasonable adjustments to facilitate students with a range of disabilities including physical, visual, hearing, learning, medical and mental. (NB Do NOT ask the student directly if they have a disability)
  - Accommodation and travel to work

- Both Visits
  - Review the students placement journal before the visit and provide some constructive feedback comments on content/structure/completeness.
  - Ask the student to outline a typical day’s/week’s work and get the student to elaborate on any interesting elements of the work carried out.
  - Discuss the training received software packages used etc.
  - Look for evidence of development of any of the placement competencies (independence, flexibility, timekeeping, teamwork, interpersonal skills, self-awareness, organisation and planning, health and safety awareness, social and professional awareness, technical expertise) and probe where necessary. This is important as you will need confirm that the student has achieved all the competencies by the completion of the second visit.
  - Ask students to reflect on the skills are they developing. This is particularly important and they should be asked to record reflective elements in their Placement Journal so that they can refer to this when completing the reflection section of the final report.

### Discuss with Supervisor

The following items should be discussed with the industrial supervisor:

- First Visit
  - Student Health & Safety induction (i.e. simply check it has happened by the first visit)
  - Company policy on Bullying & Harassment (i.e. check at first visit does a policy exist and was it covered at induction?). Has the student flagged any disability with the company? If so, has the company dealt with it in an appropriate manner? Students are not obliged to disclose any disability. Under SENDO legislation employers must make reasonable adjustments to facilitate students with a range of disabilities including physical, visual, hearing, learning, medical and mental.

- Both Visits
  - Student’s strengths and weaknesses
  - Student’s progress to date
  - Assess the student’s performance
  - Potential for more demanding work (where deemed necessary)
  - Work programme for the rest of the year
  - Company placement requirements for next year (discuss at second visit)
  - Develop other Company – University Links

### Student Feedback

- Following discussions with the Industrial supervisor, it’s important to let student know how he/she is performing. It is recommended that you provide some verbal feedback and let them know that the feedback form will be available via Recruit.

- The final feedback/assessment form should be uploaded to Recruit (See Recruit for Academic Placement Visitors)

### Placement Competencies

- Placement is assessed via a practical element (in job performance) and an academic element (final placement report). To pass the practical element, student should have achieved the 10 placement competencies by the end of the placement.

- By the end of the first visit, it would be normal that students may have achieved a number of the competencies and others may be ‘work in progress’. Outstanding competencies provide the student with some goals to achieve by second visit. Students should not have achieved all competencies by end of first visit.

- For example, it would be extremely abnormal to award a student the ‘Technical Expertise’ competency by end of first visit. Rather they would be provided with feedback to note that they are performing as expected and that you would fully expect them to have achieved the competency by the end of the placement.

- In some exceptional cases where one or more competencies have not been met by the second visit, you should inform the student that you will be looking for additional evidence to support the competency claim in the final report. I would stress that this would be an extreme case and that to pass placement students must pass the practical placement element.

### Notable Points

- It is widely agreed that an early visit is essential to ensure that students have settled into the workplace and any teething problems addressed immediately, otherwise, what were originally minor problems can explode into major issues if left to fester. There are also other problems which may arise outside the workplace which can cause considerable distress to students, home sickness, travel or accommodation problems or even financial issues which need to be readily addressed and form an important part of the visiting academic’s remit.

- Students can feel lonely or isolated on placement and many have reported that the opportunity to talk to a “friendly face” is a very important aspect of the visits.

- Placement Visitors may therefore be required to perform the role of Mentor, Counsellor and Assessor as well as the link between the employer and the University of Ulster.

- Communication with the student during the placement is very important. The Placement Visitor must ensure that the student is fully aware of all contact details of appropriate University staff.

- Employers find visits reassuring in that the student isn’t being “dumped” for a year with the company but instead the University is sharing the responsibility for the student’s learning experience in partnership with the employer. This helps to maintain the relationship between the employer and University and may lead to other opportunities such as consultancy or research.

- Placement Visitors should be aware that visits are also opportunities:
  - for a learning or educational experience
  - to present the case for the following year's students and ensure continuity of the placement (usually during the second visit)
  - to maintain the relationship with the host organisation
  - to develop further links between the organisation and the university
  - to perform vital marketing and PR functions on behalf of the university.
- Excellence and quality must also be prerequisites in the placement process, and it is essential that we provide a high-quality service to the student and the employer. We must strive for excellence, and now that students are paying higher fees for their placement year, they will come to demand it.

## Placement Visits

### Using Recruit

An academic can login to Recruit via <https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk>, click the ‘Ulster Staff and Student Log In’ link and use their normal University email/password to authenticate. Recruit now utilises SSO and thus if you are already authenticated via email, portal etc then you will be automatically logged in.

![img](/recruit/academic/1-login.png)

Once the login has been successful, the academic can select either ‘Placement Visits’ or ‘Report Marking’ menu option and will be presented with a list of their allocated students.

![img](/recruit/academic/2-home.png)

For placement visits the allocation may look as follows

Selecting the Review operation for one student provides access to further details on the student and their placement.

![img](/recruit/academic/4-review-student.png)

Selecting ‘Review’ provides more details on the placement, including the contact details of the students industrial supervisor

![img](/recruit/academic/5-placement-details.png)

The ‘Directions’ link provides a Google map based on the post code.

![img](/recruit/academic/6-map.png)

The selected students ‘Health & Safety Checklist’ can be reviewed before the visit and issues addressed at the visit.

![img](/recruit/academic/7-hs.png)

### Schedule Visit

Agree a date/time with the student via email then on Recruit click the ‘Schedule’ operation and complete the visit schedule form with any issues for discussion and enter the agreed visit date/time.

![img](/recruit/academic/8-schedule.png)

Note the visit status and visit date are not set until the visit is scheduled.

On submitting the schedule an email with attached calendar event is sent to the student, the work supervisor and copied to the academic (note this is just a sample email).

![img](/recruit/academic/9-schedule-email.png)

Once the student has uploaded their pre-visit Placement Work Summary, it is visible to the academic via the “View Submission” links. In the event you had to upload a submission on behalf of the student, you can do so via the “Upload First/Second Visit Submission” links.

![img](/recruit/academic/10-view-submission.png)

Note in example above both visits have been scheduled and students have submitted their placement work summaries.

### Journal

Prior to completing a placement visit, the academic may review the students ‘Placement Journal’ and note any issues etc. for addressing at the visit. In the case where the student has not yet added any journal entries (as shown below), you should communicate with the student and request that they update the journal before the first visit.

![img](/recruit/academic/11-view-journal.png)

### Student Visit Feedback

Once the visit has been completed the academic will upload the Placement Visit Feedback form, providing general feedback and indicating progression on the competencies and an indicated Attainment (Pass/Fail) – this is purely formative feedback. To access the feedback option select “Feedback” link from the relevant visit.

![img](/recruit/academic/12-feedback-1.png)

Then complete the form shown below (attach the competency feedback form)

![img](/recruit/academic/12-feedback-2.png)

Following submission of feedback, the student receives an email so they know to review the feedback and take action where needed.

![img](/recruit/academic/12-feedback-3.png)

### Overall Assessment

It is essential, that following the second visit, the academic visitor should record the overall result (pass/fail) for the practical element of the placement. This can be recorded via the assessment menu as shown below.

![img](/recruit/academic/13-second-visit-1.png)

The assessment feature has to accommodate the two University assessment regimes and in our case we will ignore the % Mark awarded by the Academic Visitor and % Mark awarded by the Industrial Supervisor elements and concentrate on the Industrial Verdict element.

## Final Report

To access your allocated placement reports, login to [Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk) and select Report Marking.

![img](/recruit/academic/20-report-marking.png)

You will be presented with a list of students you have been allocated for the report marking process.

![img](/recruit/academic/21-report-list.png)

Click “View Report” to view (and download) the submitted student placement Report for each student.

>⚠️ **Note:** Only the first marker can view a students report submission. You must therefore email a copy of the report to the second marker.

### Report Grade Sheet

Each marker completes an individual placement report grade sheet, providing a grade for each achievement area and an overall grade (based on the grade table at the end of the form). Please only use the grade descriptors ( F - Fail, P - Pass, C- Commendation, D- Distinction) on the grade sheet and **do not use actual marks/percentages**.

Both markers then agree an overall agreed grade and both write this in the relevant box in their individual forms. Where there is a difference of opinion in the grades allocated, please articulate in the feedback section, how the agreed grade was arrived at. Please note that these grade sheets are made available to the students when they return to final year.

### Assessment Feedback

The first marker is then responsible for uploading the feedback and adding the overall placement grade. To do this click “Assess” against the relevant student.

![img](/recruit/academic/22-assess-1.png)

Complete the form below, ensuring

1. You select the relevant overall agreed assessment grade (Fail, Pass, Commendation, Distinction) in the Status field dropdown menu.
2. Complete the feedback as shown below.
3. Then click the Browse button to select and upload a single PDF document containing the two assessment sheets (two individual) and a CV comment sheet if required (see CV review below).
4. Once the document has been selected click submit to complete the assessment.
Note the document can be submitted multiple times and each submission simply overwrites the previous.

![img](/recruit/academic/22-assess-2.png)

When the report is assessment is submitted the status changes to reflect the agreed assessment and the student can no longer resubmit. Feedback is visible to the student from 1st October, which allows sufficient time for marks to be processed via the August exam boards.

![img](/recruit/academic/22-assess-3.png)

### CV Review

Students may submit an up-to-date copy of their CV (as an appendix to the report). Whilst the CV is not part of the assessment, the first marker should review any CV submitted and complete the CV comment sheet. This should be appended to the single report assessment feedback document before submission to Recruit.
