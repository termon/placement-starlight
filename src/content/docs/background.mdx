## Scope

The aim of this document is to offer a framework for quality assurance and control in relation to placement-learning. It also aims to enable the [School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/departments/dvc/cebe/school-of-computing-engineering-and-intelligent-systems) to support the management and operation of placement within the Faculty.

## Handbook Audience

The handbook is for students undertaking placement modules:

> - COM367 Professional Practice - Computing
> - MEC361 Placement – Magee Engineering.

and provides information and guidance on all aspects of placement preparation in Year 2 and information about what happens whilst on placement in Year 3.

## Glossary

The vocabulary of placement learning includes many terms, which are used in different ways by different Schools. The following glossary provides the definitive usage of the terms as they apply within this document.

**Placement Tutor (Co-ordinator)** is a member of academic staff designated by each School to arrange and/or approve placements and to support students through the placement process. They are also responsible for coordinating the placement process for the courses they are responsible for in collaboration with the Placement Administrator and/or Courses Coordinator.

**Placement Administrator** is a member of clerical staff within the School, providing a support role in engaging with Employers and Students. This person also acts as an information point of contact if an Academic Supervisor or Placement Tutor is unavailable.

**Courses’ Coordinator (Course Director)** is a member of academic staff who is responsible for the day to day management of one or more courses within the school and would typically be the point of contact for general course related queries/issues.

**Academic Supervisor** is a member of academic staff who conducts the specified number of placement visits.

**Industrial Supervisor** is a member of the industrial organisation providing opportunities for placement learning. This person will normally act as the student’s mentor and be responsible for assessing progress and completing relevant documentation during the placement.

**Placement (Work Based Learning)** is a planned period of learning, normally outside the University at which the student is enrolled, where the learning outcomes are an intended part of a programme of study. It includes those circumstances where students have arranged their own placement, with the approval of the Placement Tutor.

**Learning Outcomes** are the outcome from a learning process. The intended learning outcomes of placement are specified in the individual course programme specification and the corresponding student handbook. They are statements that predict what learners should have gained as a result of learning activities during the placement.

**[Handshake](https://ulster.joinhandshake.co.uk/login)**  [^1] is a tool used by the University to advertise placement and graduate posts to students. You will use this system as your primary tool to search for and apply for placement opportunities.

**[Recruit](https://recruit.ulster.ac.uk)** [^2] is a separate University system used to manage placement, and is typically used to formally record placement offers, exemption requests, and all on-placement assessment.

**Employability & Careers** [^3] is a department within the University that provides students with support in developing their employability skills during their time at University. Staff from employability and careers are involved in placement preparation activities during year 2.
