## Placement Summary

Placement (also known as *Work-based learning*) forms an integral part of all the undergraduate degree programmes of study within the School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems, within the Faculty of Computing, Engineering and the Built Environment at Ulster University.

In relation to honours degree programmes, work-based learning is a continuous period of work, normally 48 weeks in length (excluding holidays). It occurs in the penultimate year of the course and must be completed before commencement of the final year of study. Students must achieve the learning outcomes associated with the placement period before commencement of the final year of study.

Placement may be undertaken locally or abroad, depending upon the intended learning outcomes of the course and exchange arrangement in the receiving country. The placement year is formally assessed, and minimum of a Pass grade must be obtained to qualify for the award of Diploma in Professional Practice (DPP) or (DPPI) in the case of an international placement.

Some students may choose to undertake a Study Abroad programme such as [Study USA](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/goglobal/study/study-usa) or [Erasmus+](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/goglobal/study/erasmus/studies) in lieu of their placement year. In this case these students will be awarded a Diploma In Area Studies (DAS/I) instead of the normal Diploma in Professional Practice (DPP/I).

Where appropriate, students may apply for [exemption](/sceis-placement-handbook/preparation/#placement-exemption) from placement based upon verifiable evidence of relevant prior experience or qualification. Exemptions will be granted by Course Committees in accordance with the regulations outlined in the relevant course documentation. The intended learning outcomes for work-based learning are clearly articulated within the module specifications, which link to the intended learning outcomes for the programmes and are consistent with available subject benchmarks. Additionally, the assessment strategy is outlined within module specifications and is contained within this handbook.

Full-time undergraduate courses within the School of Computing, Engineering and Intelligent Systems contain a placement element.

## Placement Benefits

Placement is an integral part of our degrees and has clearly defined benefits for the student, the employer and the university.

### Student Benefits

Placements are aimed at providing students with the experience and discipline of working in a computing / engineering environment and the opportunity to develop skills in particular areas. They will also gain insight into the wider commercial aspects of business life including the management of the organisation and the client-company relationship. In particular students will gain

- The experience and discipline of working in a relevant computing/engineering environment.
- Personal development: self-confidence, self-discipline, responsibility etc.
- An insight into the wider commercial aspects of business life including exposure to company management and the client-company relationship
- Intellectual challenge and possible ideas for final year project
- Clarifying final year studies and future career opportunities
- Improved employability including possibility of a graduate job offer on completion of their degree.
- Salary and financial implications. Some students receive sponsorship from their employer to complete the final year of their course.

Students who undertake placements recognise the vital role that work experience plays in enhancing their career progression and employability prospects following graduation. Students returning to University from their placement year overwhelmingly agreed that time on placement had been a positive experience, claiming the main positive aspects as an increased confidence and maturity, both in interpersonal skills and aptitude for learning.

### Employer Benefits

At a reasonable cost, employers can benefit from an enthusiastic staff member, fresh from two years undergraduate study, who can often be targeted at specific short to medium term projects. The student comes equipped with specific subject related skills, as well as an up-to-date overview of the relevant computing and engineering disciplines, and should become fully productive at an early stage.
Many employers are also keen to make (and to be seen to make) a positive contribution towards the provision of a high-quality work force for the future. As a placement organisation, it is also easy to make known to the academic community views and requirements regarding higher education.

Whilst there is not normally a long-term commitment to future recruitment, there is obvious potential, particularly where placements are linked to sponsorship. Sponsorship arrangements vary greatly but can include financial support whilst studying, vacation employment and, possibly, an eventual employment arrangement. Potential employers should note that placement students must return for final year. It is not unusual for companies to gain favourable publicity because of sponsorship arrangements.

In particular, the employer will gain

- Cost effective source of labour
- Motivated, committed, and loyal employee
- Opportunity to assess student’s potential for future employment
- Flexibility in staff deployment and increased productivity
- Increased awareness of current academic developments in computing / engineering
- Breakthrough thinking (not blinkered or stereotyped)
- Generating goodwill within the academic community
- Payback (Putting something back into the system)

### University Benefits

Primarily, placements help us to provide graduates with the qualities that employers have told us they require. The links with industry, which placements promote, also help us to keep abreast of changing requirements and can lead to other joint ventures such as custom-built training courses and collaborative research.

## Placement People

 1. **Placement Tutor / Coordinator**

    The Placement Tutor is responsible for overall coordination of placement activity and is your first point of contact during the placement preparation phase.

 2. **Academic/Industrial Supervisors**

    During your placement you will be visited twice by an academic member of staff allocated as your “Academic Supervisor”. The academic supervisor is your primary (academic) point of contact during your placement, with the placement tutor being the secondary point of contact. Your placement company will also allocate a member of staff as your “Industrial Supervisor”, who will be responsible for your supervision within the company.

 3. **Placement Administrator**

    The Placement Administrator is a member of the school office staff who carries out various administrative tasks during the placement process. You may receive communications from the administrator regarding placement opportunities, events or other important activities.

 4. **Courses Coordinator (Course Director)**

    The Courses’ Coordinator is a member of the school academic staff who manages one or more courses within the school and is someone you may receive communications from time to time regarding placement activity.

 5. **Employability & Careers**

    The Employability & Careers department within the University provide students with support in developing their employability skills during their time at University. Employability staff are involved in various placement preparation activities in year 2.
